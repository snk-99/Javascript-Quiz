Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Samuel kahura!

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, youâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessmentâ€”perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this unit, this weekâ€™s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.
